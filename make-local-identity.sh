# One-time setup for local builds: creates a self-signed code-signing certificate named
# "Tidy Mac Local Signing" in your login keychain and trusts it for code signing.
#
# Why: macOS remembers permissions (Downloads, Automation, Notifications) per app *signature*.
# An ad-hoc signed build gets a brand-new signature every time it is built, so macOS asks for
# every permission again after each rebuild. A stable certificate means one set of prompts,
# then never again, even across rebuilds. build-app.sh uses this certificate automatically
# when it exists. For distribution to other Macs use a Developer ID instead (see notarize.sh).
#
# You may see one or two keychain prompts. Enter your login password when asked.
